## Goals
In this lab we will:
- Learn to implement the model $f_{w,b}$ for linear regression with one variable



## Problem Statement

For this exercise, we will use the motivating example of housing price prediction.
This lab will use a simple data set with only two data points - a house with 1000 square feet(sqft) sold for $300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for $500,000. These two points will constitute our data or training set. In this lab, the units of size are 1000 sqft and the units of price are 1000s of dollars.
